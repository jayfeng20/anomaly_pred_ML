1. Data preprocess:
    Labeled 10 cycles before each FSR Required alarm as 1 and the rest 0, regardless of cycle type.

    Assumptions: 
        1. all cycles would reflect the leading up of an alarm before an alarm happens

2. Features:
    Cycle metadata -> count: 2
        cycle duration, numerical
        cycle type, categorical
    Digital -> count: number of sensors * 4
        number of activations for each sensor, numerical
        starting status for each sensor 0/1
        ending status for each sensor 0/1
        relative time of first activation for each sensor, numerical
    Analog -> count: number of channels * 2
        number of strict local minima for each channel, numerical
        number of strict local maxima for each channel, numerical
    
    Reasons and Assumptions:
        1. Number of digital activations is clearly crucial
        2. Starting and ending status of digitals capture whether a sensor is started or left 
        on or off outside of a cycle
        3. Relative first activation time can capture overall left and right shifting of plot 
        4. As we have discussed, most changes in analog readings are a reflection of a digital 
        status change, however, small fluctuations could foretell potential failures so after 
        observing the data, I noticed majority of the data is smooth, meaning no fluctuations, 
        so I chose strict < and > relationships to capture the number of peaks and pits 
        in a channel during a cycle. The algorithm also takes into account plateaus and basins
        e.g. [1,1,2,2,2,1,1] would be considered as having 1 peak and [3,2,1,1,1,2,3] would be 
        considered as having 1 pit
        
3. Target/label:
    FSR Required or not, 1/0
